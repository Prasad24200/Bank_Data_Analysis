# Financial_Bank_Analysis. 

# What problem I am solving in this project 

### A financial institution needed insights into its data to understand better loan performance, applicant behavior, and regional trends. 

### My Goal
My task was to analyze the loan dataset and create a dashboard that highlights key metrics like:

Total loan applications

Total Deposits by Gender

Business Lending by Gender

Bank Loan ,Total Fees

And breakdowns of good vs bad loans.

## My Approach
Data Cleaning in Excel

KPI Extraction and Validation using SQL

Visualization and interactive dashboard design in Power BI

Insight generation and stakeholder reporting

# Important terms about the finance domain that we should know should know
## 1) DTI 
--> Debt-to-Income Ratio should be around 30 to 35 %. It is a deciding factor that we should give a loan to the customer or not 

## The Dashboard is divided into 3 parts 
### 1) Summary

### Slicers
1)  Date-Time
2)  Gender
3)  Banking Relationship

### 2) Loan Analysis

### Cards
1) Select Measure -->
                 Total Loan |Business Lending | Credit Cards |
   
2) Bank Loan by Income Band

#### so the whole dashboard will change for the slicer

### 3)Deposit Analysis

### Cards
1)Total Deposit
2) Bank Deposit
3) Saving Account Amount
4) Checking Account Amount


## Tools and use case
I used a combination of Excel, SQL, and Power BI:

In Excel, I cleaned the raw CSV data, handled missing values, and did initial exploration.

Using SQL, I wrote queries to extract KPIs like total business lending, bank deposit, and total fees. I also used SQL to validate the backend data logic powering the dashboard.

Finally, I used Power BI to design a 5-page dashboard:

Summary for high-level KPIs,

Overview for monthly and regional trends,

Details for deeper insights like client details, banking relationship, and total fees.



## Conclusion
The dashboard provided clear insights:

Identified that most loans were issued in commercial banks,

Found that good loans outnumbered bad loans significantly,

And showed that total deposits with total fees .
These insights help the bank improve risk assessment and target the right customer segments.
